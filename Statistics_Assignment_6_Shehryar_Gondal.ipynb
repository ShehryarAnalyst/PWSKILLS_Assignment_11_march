    "A one-tailed test is a statistical test in which the null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic falls either entirely in the upper or lower tail of the probability distribution. The alternative hypothesis is only interested in detecting an effect in one direction. For example, if a researcher wants to test if a new medication will increase the response time of participants, a one-tailed test will be used in which the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the groups and the alternative hypothesis would be that the medication will increase response time. The rejection region will only be on one side of the distribution (either the upper or lower tail) depending on the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n",

For example, if a researcher wants to test if a new treatment for a disease is effective, a two-tailed test will be used, in which the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the groups, and the alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference (either an increase or decrease in effectiveness). The rejection region will be on both sides of the distribution (both the upper and lower tail).\n",

    "Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. In other words, a Type 1 error is a false positive, where the researcher concludes that there is a significant difference or effect when there is not. The probability of making a Type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α) and is set by the researcher before conducting the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example scenario of a Type 1 error is a medical researcher testing a new drug to lower blood pressure. If the researcher concludes that the drug is effective in lowering blood pressure when it is not, this would be a Type 1 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. In other words, a Type 2 error is a false negative, where the researcher fails to detect a significant difference or effect when there is one. The probability of making a Type 2 error is denoted by beta (β) and is influenced by factors such as sample size, effect size, and statistical power.\n",
